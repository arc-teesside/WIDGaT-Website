<h1>What are Use Cases?</h1>

WIDGaT utilises use cases, which consist of a persona and scenario, for each widget aimed to provide a pedagogical basis for the widgets and to support sharing and adaptation activities. Personas can be thought of as hypothetical users, fictional people who represent classes of users, and have been used in a number of projects to describe typical users.<br /><br />

To ensure that the potential of the WIDGaT toolkit can be realised we have gathered a number of use cases from a range of stakeholders, including academics, teachers, learning designers and students. The Use Cases, which were gathered during the <a href="index.php?p=about#wip">WIDGaT in Practice (WiP)</a> User Trials and will be hosted alongside the associated widgets and their learning designs on ROLE, EDUKapp and JORUM, are presented below:<br /><br />
