<!-- <h1>WIDGaT &ndash; Widget Design Authoring Toolkit</h1>

Widget Design Authoring Toolkit (WIDGaT) is a JISC-funded Learning and Teaching Innovation project led by the Accessibility Research Centre at Teesside University.<br /><br />

The project aims to explore, design, develop and evaluate a WIDGaT toolkit that will support the design, development and sharing of widgets by those directly involved in the teaching and support of disabled students<br /><br />

By engaging pedagogical and technical experts with our intended end users the objective is to produce a WIDGaT authoring tool that enables teachers or students to develop and share bespoke widgets.<br />

<p>The&nbsp; outputs will be the WiDGAT toolkit that will be a freely available, open source, application that can be downloaded, adapted and hosted by any HE or FE institution or individual. It will support the creation, adaptation and sharing of&nbsp; open source, W3C standard-compliant widgets. The tool will take users through the process, with links to key process information to enable them to easily produce a widget of direct value to their learners. It will comprise a kind of expert system &ndash; the Design Decision Maker that will help the user specify the design and functionality of the proposed widget, an authoring tool with templates and libraries of API&rsquo;s and services and a database for storage of designs and widgets.</p>

<h1>Overview</h1>

The WIDGaT toolkit was built on the experience and success of three JISC funded projects under the Learning and Teaching Innovative programme: <a href="#wide">Widgets for Inclusive and Distributed Environments (WIDE)</a>, <a href="#widgat">WIDGaT: A W3C Widget Design and Authoring Toolkit</a> and <a href="#wip">WIDGaT in Practice (WiP)</a>. All of these projects were responding to the demand for flexible, personalised and distributed learning. WIDGaT supports the education sector in the self-design and development of open source, ARIA Compliant W3C standard widgets that contribute towards the realisation of Adaptable Personal Learning Environments and address particularly, but not exclusively, the needs and preferences of disabled students. The project utilises existing JISC tools and projects where possible to extend our existing Community of Practice.
<br /><br />
The concept of Distributed or Personal Learning Environments has been explored by JISC (Distributed Learning Environments Programme) and others, as a means of addressing the changing pedagogical requirements of students, the opportunities afforded by Web 2.0 tools and the emergence of new paradigms of social media. One of the main driving forces of this change is the increasing demand for personalisation of resources and experiences. For disabled students, personalisation can represent increased participation and independence. Providing the opportunity for adaptable personal learning through tools, learning aids and services (or widgets) that are freely available, easy to create and adapt is one way that this personalisation can be achieved. While our primary focus is disabled students, the same benefits apply to all students.

<h2><a id="wide" name="wide" class="anchor">Widgets for Inclusive and Distributed Environments (WIDE)</a></h2>

Initially, the JISC funded WIDE project led by the Accessibility Research Centre at Teesside University, demonstrated a successful model of community development of widgets, by bringing together groups of staff directly involved in the teaching or support of disabled students, accessibility experts, developers and researchers we collaborated to design, specify and develop a suite of bespoke widgets that met the identified and specific requirements of disabled students. This collaborative approach proved very successful and the outputs were encouraging but its limitations were also apparent:

<ul>
	<li>The approach was resource intensive in terms of the development time and expertise required.</li>
	<li>It became apparent that it would not be feasible for most teachers or students to develop their own widgets without considerable technical support.</li>
</ul>

In order to make the approach sustainable and to maximise the potential personalisation of learning we identified the need for a set of tools that could be used by non-developers.

<h2><a id="widgat" name="widgat" class="anchor">WIDGaT: A W3C Widget Design and Authoring Toolkit</a></h2>

The findings of the WIDE project highlighted the need for a toolkit that would automate the process of designing, specification and development of widgets. This was the genesis of the WIDGaT project funded for one year under the Learning and Teaching Innovation Programme. In order to create an environment whereby a Community of Practice could flourish requires a set of authoring tools (incorporating libraries of templates, services and APIs and links to a repository or store) that would enable academics without technical skills to develop, modify, adapt and share widgets. Once again this project engaged with and extended our existing CoP to bring together experts in open source and free educational tools to produce the design and technical specification for the code free widget authoring tool.

WIDGaT followed an agile development methodology with frequent user testing culminating in evaluation by the CoP. The result of the WIDGaT project was an open source functional framework with two content rich templates based on the WIDE widgets, a use case recording facility and the ability to export widgets to the ROLE store. The toolkit provides a sustainable and self managed means of specifying, developing and sharing widgets without the need for a technical expert &#8211; In effect this will be provided through an expert system.

Toolkit components:
<ul>
	<li>The Design Decision Maker: defines the parameters of the widget in terms of persona, usage scenario and adaptation.</li>
	<li>The Authoring Tool: Provides a widget design template with API, services and content library.</li>
	<li>WIDER: A repository for storage, retrieval, rating and data storage for individual widgets</li>
</ul>

<h2><a id="wip" name="wip" class="anchor">WIDGaT in Practice (WiP)</a></h2>

The WIDGAT in Practice (WiP) project was built upon the lessons learned and success of the two previously funded JISC projects, Widgets for Inclusive and Distributed Environments (WIDE) and WIDGaT: A W3C Widget Design and Authoring Toolkit. WIDE and WIDGaT demonstrated a need and a willingness by practitioners to create widgets to support their learners, and that a toolkit can enable practitioners without coding skills to make widgets themselves.

In the WIDE and WIDGaT projects we brought together and developed a Community of Practice to engage practitioners, students, designers and developers from across the sector. Using collaborative and agile methods we were able to design, specify, develop and test first a collection of bespoke widgets and then the widget authoring toolkit.

The primary aim of the WiP project was to demonstrate the tools ease of use and to bring guidance and exemplars to the wider education community in order to stimulate momentum within the Community of Practice that will self perpetuate beyond the JISC funding period. WiP&#8217;s structured programme was designed to enrich the content of WIDGaT, undergo stability testing and introduce it to users across the sector. In addition, the outputs of the project include a number of advocacy artefacts, such as use cases, which capture pedagogical basis for the widgets and example widgets to increase awareness and uptake of the toolkit, and an online user guide in the form of a TechDis staff pack, hosted on the JISC TechDis web site and linked to from the WIDGaT support web site. This user guide will help to encourage take up of WIDGaT beyond this project particularly by anyone interested in developing widgets to support disabled learners in particular.
