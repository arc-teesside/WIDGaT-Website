<h1>WIDGaT &ndash; Widget Design Authoring Toolkit</h1>

Widget Design Authoring Toolkit (WIDGaT) is a JISC-funded Learning and Teaching Innovation project led by the Accessibility Research Centre at Teesside University.<br /><br />

The project aims to explore, design, develop and evaluate a WIDGaT toolkit that will support the design, development and sharing of widgets by those directly involved in the teaching and support of disabled students<br /><br />

By engaging pedagogical and technical experts with our intended end users the objective is to produce a WIDGaT authoring tool that enables teachers or students to develop and share bespoke widgets.<br />

<h2>Project Overview</h2>
					
					<div class="entry-content">
						<p>The WiDGAT toolkit (Design Decision Maker, Authoring Tool and repository) will support the education sector in the self-design and development of open source, ARIA Compliant W3C standard widgets. It will enable the creation of widgets that contribute towards the realisation of Adaptable Personal Learning Environments and address particularly (but not exclusively) the needs and preferences of disabled students<strong>. </strong>The project will utilise existing JISC tools and projects where possible to extend our existing Community of Practice (<a title="Widgets for Inclusive Distributed Environments Project-Opens in a new window" href="http://arc.tees.ac.uk/wide" target="_blank">JISC WIDE project</a>).</p>
<p>&nbsp;The concept of Distributed or Personal Learning Environments has been explored by JISC (<a title="JISC Distributed Learning Environments Programme-Opens in a new page" href="http://www.jisc.ac.uk/whatwedo/programmes/elearning/distributedvle.aspx" target="_blank">Distributed Learning Environments Programme</a>) and others, as a means of addressing the changing pedagogical requirements of students, the opportunities afforded by Web 2.0 tools and the emergence of new paradigms of social media. One of the main driving forces of this change is the increasing demand for personalisation of resources and experiences. For disabled students, personalisation can represent increased participation and independence. Providing the opportunity for adaptable personal learning through tools, learning aids and services (or widgets) that are freely available, easy to create and adapt is one way that this personalisation can be achieved. While our primary focus is disabled students, the same benefits would apply to all students.</p>
<p>The recent JISC funded WIDE project led by the Accessibility Research Centre at Teesside University, demonstrated a successful model of community development of widgets,by bringing together groups of staff directly involved in the teaching or support of disabled students, accessibility experts, developers and researchers we collaborated to design, specify and develop a suite of bespoke widgets that met the identified and specific requirements of disabled students. This collaborative approach proved very successful and the outputs were encouraging but its limitations were also apparent:</p>
<ul>
<li>The approach was resource intensive in terms of the development time and expertise required</li>
<li>It became apparent that it would not be feasible for most teachers or students to develop their own widgets without considerable technical support.</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to make the approach sustainable and to maximise the potential personalisation of learning we have identified the need for a set of tools that can be used by non-developers. The WiDGAT toolkit will automate the process of designing, specification and development of widgets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And draw on the successful model of JISC WIDE and take a collaborative approach to the design, development and evaluation of a toolkit that replicates the process used in the WIDE workshop and will utilise existing JISC tools and projects where possible to extend our existing Community of Practice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The toolkit will provide a sustainable and self managed means of specifying, developing and sharing widgets without the need for a technical expert &ndash; In effect this will be provided through an expert system.</p>
<p><em>Toolkit components:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>The Design Decision Maker: defines the parameters of the widget in terms of persona, usage scenario and adaptation.</li>
<li>The Authoring Tool: provides a widget design template with API, services and content library.</li>
<li><a title="Widgets for Inclusive Distributed Environments Repository-Opens in a new window" href="http://arc.tees.ac.uk/WIDER" target="_blank">WIDER</a>: a repository for storage, retrieval, rating and data storage for individual widgets</li>
</ul>
<p>The&nbsp; outputs will be the WiDGAT toolkit that will be a freely available, open source, application that can be downloaded, adapted and hosted by any HE or FE institution or individual. It will support the creation, adaptation and sharing of&nbsp; open source, W3C standard-compliant widgets. The tool will take users through the process, with links to key process information to enable them to easily produce a widget of direct value to their learners. It will comprise a kind of expert system &ndash; the Design Decision Maker that will help the user specify the design and functionality of the proposed widget, an authoring tool with templates and libraries of API&rsquo;s and services and a database for storage of designs and widgets.</p>
