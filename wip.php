<h1>WIDGaT in Pratice (WiP)</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
The WiP project will build on the experience, lessons learned and success of the two previously funded JISC projects: Widgets for Inclusive and Distributed Environments (WIDE) and WIDGaT: A W3C Widget Design and Authoring Toolkit. Both of these projects were responding to the demand for flexible, personalised and distributed learning.
<br /><br />
In the WIDE and WIDGaT projects we have brought together and developed a Community of Practice to engage practitioners, students, designers and developers from across the sector. Using collaborative and agile methods we were able to design, specify, develop and test first a collection of bespoke widgets and then the widget authoring toolkit.
<br />
<h2>Aims &amp; Objectives</h2>
The primary aim of the WIDGaT in Practice (WiP) project is to demonstrate its ease of use and bring guidance and exemplars to the wider education community to build a sustainable momentum within the Community of Practice that will self perpetuate beyond the JISC funding period. The WIDE and WIDGaT projects demonstrated a need and a willingness by practitioners to create widgets to support their learners, and that a toolkit can enable practitioners without coding skills to make widgets themselves. WiP will be a structured programme to enrich the content of WIDGaT,  undergo stability  testing, introduce it to users across the sector, gather use cases and prepare  user documentation and support for wider deployment. 
<br /><br /> 
The output WiP will provide a model for the JISC community demonstrating the process of moving from user need to sustainable open tool.
<br />
<h2>Workshops</h2>
A series of three training workshops will take place to increase awareness of WIDGaT across three diverse educational sectors (Higher Education, Further Education and Special Colleges). The workshops will involve 40 &ndash; 60 staff and the main objective is to identify a total of 16 participants who will volunteer to evaluate WIDGaT in authentic classroom situations by producing their own widgets and trialing them with learners.
